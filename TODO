- Decide on initial feature set
- Create script (Grunt?) to:
  - run tests
  - package app into zip
- JsLint
- onError? (note: jqXHR responseText is a String)
- only called once, on readyState 4?
- jqXHR?
- shouldMock when library not present
- $.ajax() currently only implemented with "options" object
- anyMethod()
- modify request/response headers?
- Check if methods can be declared in beforeEach() and/or afterEach()
