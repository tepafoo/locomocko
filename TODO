- Decide on initial feature set
- Create script (Grunt?) to:
  - run tests
  - package app into zip
- JsLint
- onError? (note: jqXHR responseText is a String)
- only called once, on readyState 4?
- shouldMock when library not present
- $.ajax() currently only implemented with "options" object
- anyMethod()
- do not mock again on multiple calls to shouldMock()
Angular
- implement mocked $http with request/response transforms
- angular:
  - implement http promise then() method
  - throw error if header() called with non-String type?
  - edge cases:
    - only return first occurrence of a (key,value) pair in config object
    - throw error if transformRequest/transformResponse not functions
